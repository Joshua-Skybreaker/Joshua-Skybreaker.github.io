# Resume Projects
I'm hoping to use this page to complement my resume by showcasing some of the projects I've completed.

I feel confident in my Java programming skills but I haven't explored many languages outside of that. I've dabbled a little in Python, html, css, and PostgreSQL; but I feel that programming "clicks" with me. My goal is to land an entry level IT job before I graduate with a technical degree in the summer of 2022.

If you have any suggestions on projects I should complete to further this goal, please shoot me an email at joshuaskybreaker@gmail.com

## Projects:
### 1. [Coffee Shop Prototype](https://github.com/Joshua-Skybreaker/advJavaProject):completed 7/26/21.
This project showcases my knowledge of JDBC, writing/reading/sorting/searching databases, working with a collection, and data validation. This program has uses multiple JFrames and is based on several different parameters outlined by my instructor. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Joshua-Skybreaker/Joshua-Skybreaker.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Joshua-Skybreaker/Joshua-Skybreaker.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
