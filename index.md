# Resume Projects
I'm hoping to use this page to complement my resume by showcasing some of the projects I've completed.

I feel confident in my Java programming skills but I haven't explored deep into many languages outside of that. I know a little bit of Python, html, css, and PostgreSQL; but I feel that programming really "clicks" with me and I love doing it. My goal is to land an entry level IT job before I graduate with a technical degree in the summer of 2022. I have been thinking of focusing on back-end programming but if you have any suggestions: **please email me!**

I'm just now starting to work on projects to show so **ANY** suggestions about _anything_ would be awesome! Just shoot me an email at joshuaskybreaker@gmail.com
  
  
## Projects:
### 1. [Coffee Shop Prototype](https://github.com/Joshua-Skybreaker/advJavaProject): completed 7/26/21.
This project showcases my knowledge of JDBC, writing/reading/sorting/searching databases, working with a collection, and data validation. This program has uses multiple JFrames and is based on several different parameters outlined by my instructor. 

It is designed as a prototype to present to a potential client who owns a coffee shop (not a cafe -weird, I know). You have prototype controls that allow you to insert test records so that you can display customer, coffee, and order data. 

### 2. [Personal Budget](https://github.com/Joshua-Skybreaker/budgetProject): not yet started.
I thought that building this one could be useful for my life in general and I may as well show it too. If anyone can think of something I could add that would make it stand out, please let me konw.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Joshua-Skybreaker/Joshua-Skybreaker.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
